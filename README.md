# Simple CI3-HMVC CMS
This project was originally completed following a CodeIgniter tutorial on YouTube by ABC Tutorials about eight years ago. At that time, the CI version used was 3.0.3 with PHP version as 5.5.11 and uses Bootstrap 3. I modified it shortly afterwards using CodeIgniter HMVC, as taught by web developer extraordinaire David Connelly, in 2016.

I have updated the CI version to version 3.1.13 with PHP Version 7.2. The HMVC Modular Extensions (MX) files, particularly the Loader, Modules and Router files, have also been updated. The app has not been tested with PHP 8.

I must stress that this is a VERY basic, no-frills, project. It was fully functional when first completed in 2016. 

It goes without saying, then, that it is not meant to be used in production as is. 

For example, the password field uses MD5 for my own approach to rapid application development (RAD).

There is a lot of room for building and expanding on this project. For example, you might wish to implement a completely separate admin system with its own template. Or improving the way sessions are applied throughout the app. Or it could be the basis for a school/college/univeristy project. Or...
